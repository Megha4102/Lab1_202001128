Functional and non functional requirements
Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs:

Functional Requirements :

•It defines a system or its component.

•It specifies what software will do

•It is specified by user

•It is mandatory

•Helps to verify functionality of software

•It is easy to define

Non functional requirements :

•Defines quality attributes of software system

•Specified by technical people

•Not mandatory

•Captured as quality attribute

•Helps to verify performance of software

•It is difficult to define


Library Information System(LIS)

Functional Requirements:

  ● For log in :
  
     →Has different role to log in to LIS such as student , library staff , librarian and  other

     →Check whether LAN is connected or not and using campus wifi or not
     
     →Facility to log in to system with only correct credentials
     
  ● For issue and return:
  
     →System allows to borrow and return books only to institute member
     
     →System allows user to extend borrow date if no booking for that particular book

     →Issue and return of books was restricted only to valid users 
     
  ● For security:
  
    →System allows log in to only those who are connected to institute network
    
    →System must asks for password and will be stored in the form hidden character not as plain text
    

Non Functional Requirements:

  Scalability
  Reliablity
  Performance
  Usability
  Maintenability
  
 ● Log in page will direct to system with latency of 5 minutes of logged in
 
 ● System will sort books according user's interest in the increasing of order of alphabet to provide reliability
 
 ● System will process request within 10 second of time to increase system performance
 
 ● System will design in such way that user can easily interact with system to provide usability
 
 ● System will store the information of user such as which author's book user read most,which subject books user read etc
 
 ● System will show how many books user has issued and how many are near to return date with book name and issue date to provide maintenability
 
 ● System will have good design to attract user to provide usability
 
 
Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.

  ●Scope:
  
  Approximately 466 million people suffering from disabling hearing loss 
  
  ●Features :
  
  uses artificial intelligence
  
  works in real time use
  
  also optimized for android
  
  recognize key sound events
  
  ●Non Functional aspects:
  
  Add new recognizable sounds to system for maintaning system
  
  System was designed in such a way that it increases hearing power of user
  
  No sound will harm the user
  
  System runs smoothly to provide usablity
  
  User will able to interact with system without any external help to provide usablity
